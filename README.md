# Optimization of University Course Allocation

## Description

The project aims to compare different algorithms for course allocation within a university. Two approaches, the Hungarian Algorithm and a Brute-force method, are implemented.

## Implementation

### Brute-force

- This is a trivial brute-force approach to the problem where inputs are taken from an `input.json` file.
- The script processes the input data and extracts information about professors, their groups, and course preferences.
- All possible combinations of courses are generated, and assignments are done iteratively.
- Details of valid assignments are stored in a JSON file.
- (Do note that `bruteforce.py` is a test file to check the functioning of the brute-force mechanism; it may not work, please do not run this.)

### Hungarian Algorithm

- The `networkx` library is used to create a bipartite graph with two sets of nodes: professors and courses. Professors are divided into three groups based on the courses they can take per semester.
- Based on the grouping of each professor, they are made as multiple nodes (1 if grouping is 0.5, 2 if grouping is 1, 3 if grouping is 1.5) to satisfy constraints.
- Edges with weights are added between professors and courses, forming a complete bipartite graph. 
- The algorithm is then run to find all possible perfect matchings (via enumerations), stored in a matches list.
- A check for duplicate solutions is performed using hash functions. Valid matches are stored in a `valid_matches` list, sorted to determine the best possible solution.
- All outputs are stored in an `all_output.json` file.

## Test Cases and Results

- To generate test cases, alter the specifications in the config file and run the `test_case_gen.py` program.
- This provides an `input.json` file, which can be used as input for the programs.
- Seven test cases are provided in the repository in the `test_cases` folder.
- Each folder contains an `input.json` file and all the outputs of the Hungarian algorithm.
- Our algorithm further tests for crash cases and follows through with `Exception`s due to invalid groupings or such.

## Running the Project
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/BitC3t/CSF222_DiSCo`
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Change the `config.json` in the `config` folder: you can change the number of professors, number of CDCs & electives (for both FD and HD), this will help our test case generator create a valid test case for running the algorithm. Do note that the `total` variable in the file MUST be the sum of all courses (ie total must be 30, if there are 10 FD_CDCs, 10 HD_CDCs, 5 FD_Electives, 5 HD_Electives). `fd_c` represents FD CDCs; `fd_e` represents FD Electives; `hd_c` represents HD CDCs; `hd_e` represents HD Electives.
- Generate test cases: `python3 test_case_gen.py`: Reads from `config.json`
- Run algo.py: `python3 algo.py`: Reads from input.json => Outputs to all_outputs.json
